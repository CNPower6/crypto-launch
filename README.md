🚀 How to Run CryptoLaunch
This project consists of two parts:

1. 🌐 A Flask server (already live at https://crypto-launch-e430d83afb8b.herokuapp.com/)
2. 📱 A Swift iOS app built with Xcode

Since the server is already deployed, you only need to set up the iOS app locally.

🛠 Steps to Run:
1. Clone the Repository
   
  git clone https://github.com/CNPower6/crypto-launch.git
  
  cd crypto-launch/CryptoLaunchApp

3. Install CocoaPods dependencies
  Make sure you have CocoaPods installed. If you don’t:
  sudo gem install cocoapods

  Then install the required pods:
  pod install

4. Open the Xcode Project
  Open the .xcworkspace file (not the .xcodeproj):
  open CryptoLaunch.xcworkspace

5. Build and Run
  🛜 Select an iPhone simulator or plug in your real device.
  ▶️ Press Run (⌘ + R) in Xcode.

That's it! Enjoy launching your very own cyrptocurrency!
